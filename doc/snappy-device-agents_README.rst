Snappy Device Agents
####################

Device agents scripts for provisioning and running tests on Snappy
devices

Supported Devices
=================

BeagleBone Black
----------------

To use snappy-device-agent with a BeagleBone, you will need to first
replace the image on emmc with a customized one.  The installer image
can be downloaded from::

    http://people.canonical.com/~plars/snappy/

Next, create a config file to give it some hints about your environment.
The config file for BeagleBone needs to have the address (host or ip) of
you test system once it boots, a list of commands to force it to boot the
master (emmc) image, a list of commands to force it to boot the test (snappy)
image, and a list of commands to force a hard poweroff/poweron.

If you have a very simple setup, these command scripts could be as
simple as a script to run over ssh. In a production environment, it
could be calling a REST API to trigger a relay and force these things.
Different devices can even use different config files. The config file
gives you the flexibility to define what works for this particular device.

Example::

    device_ip: 192.168.1.147
    select_master_script:
        - ssh pi@192.168.1.136 bin/setboot master
    select_test_script:
        - ssh pi@192.168.1.136 bin/setboot test
    reboot_script:
        - ssh pi@192.168.1.136 bin/hardreset

Raspberry Pi 2
--------------
Using the provisioning kit with Raspberry Pi 2 is similar to the Beaglebone.
The rpi2 will need to have a USB stick inserted for the test image, and the
SD card should boot the raspberry pi image from::

    http://people.canonical.com/~plars/snappy/

The snappy-device-agent script should just be called with the rpi2
subcommand instead of bbb.

Also, the default.yaml file passed to snappy-device-agent should include::

    test_device: /dev/sda

x86-64 Baremetal
----------------

The x86 baremetal device is currently supported using a process called inception. We boot from an ubuntu-server install running on a usb stick by default, then modify the grub entry on the host to add a boot entry for snappy on the hard drive.

The boot entry looks like this::

    # LAAS Inception Marker (do not remove)
    menuentry "LAAS Inception Test Boot (one time)" {
    insmod chain
    set root=hd1
    chainloader +1
    }
    # Boot into LAAS Inception OS if requested
    if [ "${laas_inception}" ] ; then
    set fallback="${default}"
    set default="LAAS Inception Test Boot (one time)"
    set laas_inception=
    save_env laas_inception
    set boot_once=true
    fi

To boot into this instance, you simply set the laas_inception grub variable to 1, and it will boot once into the install from the primary hard drive::

    $ sudo grub-editenv /boot/grub/grubenv set laas_inception=1

Because we install to the hard drive, and not a mmc with a known location, you should also specify the test device. Here is a complete example of a config yaml file::

    device_ip: 10.101.48.47
    test_device: /dev/sda
    select_master_script: []
    select_test_script:
        - ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null 10.101.48.47 sudo grub-editenv /boot/grub/grubenv set laas_inception=1
    reboot_script:
        - snmpset -c private -v1 pdu11.cert-maas.taipei .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.12.3.3.1.1.4.6 i 2
        - sleep 10
        - snmpset -c private -v1 pdu11.cert-maas.taipei .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.12.3.3.1.1.4.6 i 1


Logstash Logging
================

Log messages can optionally be directed to a logstash server by adding
two additional values in the yaml file::

    logstash_host: 10.0.3.207
    agent_name: test001

Logstash_host is the logstash server the messages will be sent to on port 5959.
Agent_name should be the name of the device this agent represents. It
will be added as extra data in the log message.

Exit Status
===========

Device agents will exit with a value of ''46'' if something goes wrong during
device recovery. This can be used as an indication that the device is unusable
for some reason, and can't be recovere using automated recovery mechanisms.
The system calling the device agent may want to take further action, such
as alerting someone that it needs manual recovery, or to stop attempting to
run tests on it until it's fixed.
